Implementations using Fenics and Multiphenics to solve Computational Homogenisation problems. 

This encompasses the implementation of non-standard types of boundary conditions, indeed general constraints. I made use of the Multiphenics, that allows a simple of implementation for problems of multiples variables. In this case, we have the main variable and auxiliary Lagrange multipliers variables defined in some parts of the domain that encodes the variational equation that enforces the constraint weakly.
