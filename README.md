# micmacsFenics
Implementations using Fenics and Multiphenics to solve Computational Homogenisation problems. 

This encompasses the implementation of non-standard types of boundary conditions, indeed general constraints. I made use of the Multiphenics, that allows a simple of implementation for problems of multiples variables. In this case, we have the main variable and auxiliary Lagrange multipliers variables defined in some parts of the domain that encodes the variational equation that enforces the constraint weakly. 

Coming next, micmacsFenics will be also incorporate new types of boundary conditions, in which theory will be available in "Felipe Rocha, Simone Deparis, Pablo Antolin, Annalisa Buffa, DeepBoundary: a Machine Learning approach to enhance Multi-scale Solid Mechanics, ArXiv 2021" https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11141
